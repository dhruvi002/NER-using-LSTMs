# Named Entity Recognition using LSTMs with Keras

Used the Keras API with TensorFlow as its backend to build and train a bidirectional LSTM neural network model to recognize named entities in text data. 

Named entity recognition models can be used to identify mentions of people, locations, organizations, etc. 

This project is a follow along for a Guided Project offered by the Coursera Project Network
